# Face-Recognition

Developed a custom face detection model, using OpenCV, Numpy and SKLearn datasets.
This machine learning model is for implementing the task of making a positive identification of a face in a photo or video image against a pre-existing database of faces, using KNN classification algorithm. 
It begins with detection - distinguishing human faces from other objects in the image - and then works on identification of those detected faces.
